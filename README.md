# Heterotrophy-on-bleached-corals
Influence of heterotrophy on the physiology of symbiotic and bleached corals:Lack of heterotrophic compensation in bleached corals. In this repository you'll find all raw data as well as the code we used to process these for our manuscript.

We analyzed after the 13-week feeding experiment for bleached and symbiotic corals: (I) the coral host growth (i.e., growth rates: surface area, volume growth, and calcification rates) and  (II) the photosynthesis of the coral symbionts (i.e., net photosynthesis, respiration, gross photosynthesis) of the reef-building corals Galaxea fascicularis, Porites lobata and Stylophora pistillata. For the statistical assessment and data visualization we used the statistical R Project for Statistical Computing Software together with the graphical user interface RStudio. System info of R, RStudio, and a list of all used packages can be found in this repository.
